        <h2>KITKA WIND FARM</h2>
        <p>The Kitka wind farm, located in Kamenica, Kosovo, is a facility that generates renewable energy through the use of wind turbines. Wind turbines are large structures that convert wind energy into electrical energy. To set up these turbines, special transport and assembly procedures are necessary. Transportation of wind turbines typically involves moving various components, such as turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles (the housing for the generator and other equipment), from the manufacturing site to the installation location. This process requires specialized vehicles, such as flatbed trucks or trailers that can carry oversized and heavy loads.</p>
